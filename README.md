# Super Mario Soccer

A small Super Mario soccer game written in OpenGL.

Just a college project.

There is some major memory leaks (I'm no C++ programmer) and the code is a mess (no time for refactoring right now, unfortunately).

## Controls

```
  w
a s d
```
for directional keys

`space bar` - kick

`r` - play again

`q` - quit

## Screens
